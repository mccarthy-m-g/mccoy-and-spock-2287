# Introduction

> “Enterprise Medical Log, Stardate 5327.4. Dr. Leonard McCoy recording. Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock were rescued 48 hours ago, along with several deceased members of the away team. They do not know why the creature ignored them during the attack, but I have my suspicions. The victims were all wearing red shirts.”---@mccoy5327

I am haunted by an uncomfortable reality: Over the past several weeks the number of deaths I have listed on the *Enterprise*^[The USS Enterprise (NCC-1701), a Constitution-class starship launched by Starfleet in the year 2245.] is growing, and no matter the circumstance they all share one thing in common—each and every one of them wore a red uniform. I approached First Officer Spock with my concerns, but he brushed me off as thinking with undue emotions. Our operations division wears red uniforms, so this pattern of deaths was “logical" [@spock2287].

Despite that damn Vulcan’s logic, he could not explain why himself and Captain Kirk had not yet suffered similar fates. I can find no reason why they are still alive, except, possibly, that the colour of their uniforms is somehow involved. Although improbable, it is the only hypothesis I have. Captain Kirk has employed Spock and I to conduct a study to investigate.

The aim of our study is simple: We will test whether the uniform colour of Starfleet officers on board the Enterprise cause them to suffer more severe injuries during away missions. I hypothesize that, regardless of their division, officers wearing red uniforms will suffer more severe injuries. Spock states that this is illogical, and hypothesizes that members of the operations division will continue to suffer more severe injuries no matter their uniform colour.

# Methodology

```{r study-1-data}
# This chunk demonstrates how to load a .csv file and save it as an object
# in your global environment so it can be used by other functions. For this
# manuscript I have simulated my data and saved it to a .csv file (see
# "R/data-simulation.R") to be loaded here. Because the data is simulated it
# is also already clean.
#
# If you were using real data it is likely you would need to clean it before
# running your analyses and printing their outputs in your manuscript. In such
# cases I would recommend creating a "R/data-cleaning.R" script that does all
# your data cleaning then saves the cleaned data to a new .csv file (e.g., 
# "Data/cleaned-redshirts.csv"). Then you can use the code below to read your
# cleaned data in your global environment here.

# If you use this approach and want the data cleaning script to be
# automatically run (instead of instructing people to run it manually before
# running the code chunks in this manuscript), you can simple `source()` your
# "R/data-cleaning.R" script in your setup chunk. If you want to clean your
# global environment up after sourcing this Stack Overflow question provides
# a useful script in the accepted answer:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28196493/cleaning-up-the-global-environment-after-sourcing-how-to-remove-objects-of-a-ce

# Load study data for analysis ------------------------------------------------
redshirts <- read_csv(here("Data", "redshirts.csv"))
```

## Participants

```{r participants}
# This chunk demonstrates a few important concepts that make soft-coding values
# and formatting them for printing in the body of the manuscript using inline
# R code very easy to do. These concepts are applied throughout this document,
# which you will see as you explore further.
#
# The first concept of note is the use of {dplyr} and pipes `%>%` to transform
# our redshirts data into a table of summary statistics grouped by a variable
# or variables of interest. In this case we create a summary table with counts,
# age means, and age standard deviations for each level of gender in the gender
# column of our redshirts data. If you are new to {dplyr} and `%>%`, R Studio
# has a helpful cheat sheet that can be found here:
# https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/
#
# The second concept is the use of {glue} to create interpreted string literals
# in cells of the `age_mean` and `age_sd` columns of the summary table. An
# interpreted string literal is simply a character string " " wherein any R
# expressions wrapped in single curly braces { } will be evaluated and their
# output inserted into the resulting string. In this case, for the `age_mean`
# call `glue("$\\mathit{{M_{{age}}}} = {print_num(mean(age))}$")`, the R
# expression being evaluated is: {print_num(mean(age))}. This expression
# calculates the mean age for each level of gender `mean(age)` then formats
# the resulting mean by rounding it to two decimal places with trailing zeros
# `print_num()`.
#
# The glue() call also contains two instances of double curly braces {{ }};
# these are interpreted as string literal single curly braces by glue() "{ }" so
# they are not evaluated as R expressions. This introduces us to our third
# concept, using LaTeX mathematics $ $ inside of glue() to create high-quality
# mathematical typography and expressions. The only change from writing regular
# LaTeX mathematics is that inside glue() backslashes \ and curly braces { }
# need to be doubled \\ {{ }}. So `$X^{-10}$` would be written as `$X^{{-10}$`
# and `$\mathit{hello}$` would be written as `$\\mathit{{hello}}$` inside
# glue(). If you are new to LaTeX mathematics a helpful introduction can be
# found here:
# https://michaelmccarthy.netlify.app/post/writing-statistical-formulas-in-r-markdown-documents/
# 
# The final concept is the use of split() to split the summary table into a
# named list of single row summary tables separated by a grouping variable.
# This allows you to extract elements by name both from the named list and from
# the columns of the summary table at each level of the named list using the
# `$` operator on the assigned object <- created by the transformation
# pipeline. These extractions can then be used in inline R code to print 
# soft-coded values in the body of the manuscript. In this case the summary
# table is split into a list by gender `split(.$gender)`, then values in the
# list are accessed in inline R code in the body text below this code chunk
# using, e.g., `r demographics$man$age_mean`.

# Get participant demographics for printing -----------------------------------
demographics <- redshirts %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            age_mean = glue("$\\mathit{{M_{{age}}}} = {print_num(mean(age))}$"),
            age_sd = glue("$\\mathit{{SD_{{age}}}} = {print_num(sd(age))}$")
            ) %>%
  split(.$gender)

# Get the number of excluded participants for printing ------------------------
# I'm just using this code to demonstrate printing numbers in the body as
# English words. If you actually wanted to exclude participants you'd want to
# filter them out of your dataset and calculate the total excluded from there.
exclusions <- str_to_title(english(6)) # for lowercase wrap in as.character()
```

`r nrow(redshirts)` Starfleet officers on board the starship Enterprise participated in our study, `r demographics$man$n` of which identified as men (`r demographics$man$age_mean`, `r demographics$man$age_sd`) and `r demographics$woman$n` as women (`r demographics$woman$age_mean`, `r demographics$woman$age_sd`). Myself, First Officer Spock, and Captain Kirk did not participate in the study. `r exclusions` redshirts who were supposed to participate were excluded from the study. A can be seen in Figure\ \@ref(fig:rip-redshirts), Captain Kirk foolishly sent them on an away mission; we have lost all contact since.

#
# First, a `fig.cap` chunk option is added to the chunk that states the
# reference identifier to be used for the figure. In this case

## Design

We used a 3x3 independent design to test our hypotheses, with division (science/medical, command, operations) and uniform colour (blue, yellow, red) as independent variables. The Starfleet designations for divisions and their uniform colours can be seen in Figure\ \@ref(fig:starfleet-divisions). Severity of injury---our dependent variable---was measured on a 10-point scale developed by @phlox2153, where one represented the lowest severity and ten the highest. Examples of lower severity injuries include broken bones, cellular damage, or curable infections obtained during copulation with an alien species. Higher severity injuries include decapitation by Bat'leth, exposure to delta-particle radiation, or being crushed by Tribbles.^[A Klingon's worst nightmare.]

## Procedure

Our procedure was simple, although imperfect as First Officer Spock wants us to remind you. Each Starfleet officer was randomly assigned a uniform colour they were to wear over a one month period, however, they remained within their current division due to operational constraints. Aside from this, each officer continued with their regular duties aboard the Enterprise. My medical team and I then recorded the severity of injury, division, and uniform colour for any patients that came into sickbay during the study period. Patients with multiple visits had their severity of injury scores averaged at the end of the period so their was only one score per participant.

# Results

## Two-way ANOVA assumptions

```{r assumption-normality}
# This chunk utilizes the same concepts as the `participants` chunk did but for
# a normality test instead of means and standard deviations. It also
# demonstrates how to format both the cells and headers of a table to prepare
# for printing. Cells are formatted using the `mutate()` function from {dplyr},
# and headers are formatted using the `rename()` function from {dplyr}. In this
# case I chose to use Markdown syntax to **bold** or ***italicize and bold***
# the table headers, but you can also use LaTeX mathematics to include Greek
# letters such as "$\omega$".

# Get skewness, kurtosis and Shapiro-Wilk (normality) -------------------------
# - Skewness should be in the range of +/- 2
# - Kurtosis should be in the range of +/- 7
# - Significance indicates the assumption is violated
assumption_normality <-
  test_normality(redshirts,
                 dv = injury_severity,
                 group_by = c(division, uniform_colour)) %>%
  # Prepare table for printing
  mutate(cell = str_to_title(str_replace_all(cell, "_", " "))) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(across(skewness:statistic, print_num)) %>%
  mutate(p.value = print_p(p.value, in_table = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  rename("**Cell**" = cell,
         "**Skewness**" = skewness,
         "**Kurtosis**" = kurtosis,
         "***W***" = statistic,
         "***df***" = df,
         "***p***" = p.value)
```

```{r assumption-variance}
# This chunk utilizes many of the same concepts as the `participants` and 
# `assumption-normality` chunks have, however, it introduces one new important
# function: `tidy()` from {broom}. `tidy()` summarizes information about the
# components of a model in a data frame, allowing us to transform the results
# of a statistical test in the same way we have done with other summary tables.
# Please note that not every statistical test in R has a `tidy()` method (most
# do though); however, in cases like this you can create your own function to
# tidy the model. If you ever need to do this a guide can be found here:
# https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/develop/broom/

# Run Levene's test on DV (homogeneity of variance) ---------------------------
# - Significance indicates the assumption is violated
assumption_variance <-
  car::leveneTest(injury_severity ~ division*uniform_colour,
                  data = redshirts,
                  center = mean) %>%
  # Prepare for printing
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(statistic = print_num(statistic)) %>%
  mutate(p.value = print_p(p.value)) %>%
  mutate(print = glue("$F({df}, {df.residual}) = {statistic}$, $p {p.value}$"))
```

Our data met two of the assumptions for an independent two-way ANOVA. Specifically, injury severity was measured on an interval scale, all observations for injury severity were independent, and Levene’s test showed that the variances for injury severity between each of the experiment cells were equal, `r assumption_variance$print`. One assumption was not met. Shapiro-Wilk’s test of normality showed that the distribution of injury severity within most of the experiment cells was significantly different from a normal distribution (see Table\ \@ref(tab:normality-table)); however, as discussed in @mudd2266, meeting this assumption is unnecessary for our analyses due to statistical advances in the late 21st century. Because of this, we continued with our analysis as planned.

```{r normality-table, layout="l-body-outset"}
# This chunk demonstrates how to include tables in the manuscript along with
# a numbered table caption. This works slightly differently from figures.
# There are three important differences to note.
#
# First, a `fig.cap` is not used. Instead the caption is included within the
# table object. Because of this, there is not a reference identifier to place
# in the body above the chunk for the caption either.
#
# Second, a reference to the table is placed in the body text using the format
# Table\ \@ref(tab:tag). In this case Table\ \@ref(tab:normality-table).

# Print table with caption in manuscript --------------------------------------
caption <- "Table Showing Assumption of Normality Tests."
kbl(assumption_normality,
          caption = caption,
          escape = FALSE,
          align = c("l", rep("r", 5))) %>%
  kable_minimal(lightable_options = "hover",
                html_font = "Amiri, serif")
```

## Two-way ANOVA results

```{r descriptive-statistics}
# This chunk utilizes the same concepts as the `participants` chunk did,
# however, it extends them by taking the summary table output from
# `get_descriptives()` and adding a new print column to it with ready-to-print
# strings of means and standard deviations for injury severity in each of the
# uniform colour groups. We could have done this in the `participants` chunk as
# well instead of creating separate formatted strings for the means and for the
# standard deviations.
#
# The source code for `get_descriptives()` can be found in "R/descriptives.R".

# Get descriptive statistics and prep for printing ----------------------------
descriptives <- redshirts %>%
  get_descriptives(dv = injury_severity, group_by = uniform_colour) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(print = glue("$\\mathit{{M}} = {print_num(mean)}$, ",
                      "$\\mathit{{SD}} = {print_num(std_dev)}$")
         ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  split(.$uniform_colour)
```

```{r two-way-anova}
# This chunk just reapplies concepts already used in previous code chunks.
# The only notable point to make here is the use of 
# `mutate(term = str_replace(term, ":", "_x_"))` to replace the colon in the
# string for the interaction term "division:uniform_colour" with "_x_" so the
# output stays friendly with the $ operator when printing values from the named
# list for the model. This is because strings containing certain special
# characters will be surround by backticks when using the $ operator, e.g.,
# model_list$`division:uniform_colour`$print, which means they cannot be used
# in inline R code.

# Run the two-way ANOVA with Type II sums of squares to test main effects -----
model <- aov(injury_severity ~ division*uniform_colour, data = redshirts)

# Get the two-way ANOVA table for statistical significance interpretation
model_summary <- tidy(model)

# Get effect sizes for practical significance interpretation
effsize <- effectsize::omega_squared(model) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(term = Parameter, omegasq.partial = Omega2_partial)

# Prepare model for printing --------------------------------------------------
model_list <- model_summary %>%
  left_join(effsize) %>%
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, ":", "_x_")) %>%
  mutate(df.residual = pull(filter(model_summary, term == "Residuals"), df),
         .after = df) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(across(sumsq:statistic, print_num)) %>%
  mutate(across(c(p.value, omegasq.partial), print_p)) %>%
  mutate(print = glue("$F({df}, {df.residual}) = {statistic}$, ",
                      "$p {p.value}$, ",
                      "$\\omega^2_p {omegasq.partial}$")) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  split(.$term)
```

```{r post-hoc}
# This chunk just reapplies concepts already used in previous code chunks.

# Follow up simple main effect of uniform colour ------------------------------
marginal <- emmeans(model, "uniform_colour")

marginal_contrast <- marginal %>%
  contrast(method = "pairwise") %>%
  tidy()

marginal_effsize <- marginal %>%
  eff_size(sigma = sigma(model), edf = df.residual(model)) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  rename(eff.size = estimate) %>%
  select(contrast, eff.size)

# Prepare contrasts for printing ----------------------------------------------
marginal_list <- marginal_contrast %>%
  left_join(marginal_effsize, by = "contrast") %>% 
  mutate(contrast = str_replace(contrast, "[[:space:]]-[[:space:]]", "_x_")) %>%
  # rowwise mutation is necessary when using `abs()`
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(statistic = print_num(statistic, abs = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(eff.size = abs(eff.size)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # end of rowwise computation
  mutate(across(c(adj.p.value, eff.size), print_p)) %>%
  mutate(print = glue("$t({df}) = {statistic}$, ",
                      "$p_{{\\mathit{{adj}}}} {adj.p.value}$, ",
                      "$d {eff.size}$")) %>%
  split(.$contrast)
```

There was no significant main effect of division, `r model_list$division$print`, nor was there a significant interaction effect, `r model_list$division_x_uniform_colour$print`. In support of my hypothesis (and in contempt of Spock's), there was a significant main effect of uniform colour on severity of injury, `r model_list$uniform_colour$print`. This indicates different uniform colours affected the severity of injuries Starfleet officers suffered. Specifically, post-hoc pairwise comparisons corrected using the Tukey method found that officers wearing red uniforms (`r descriptives$red$print`) suffered significantly worse injuries than officers wearing blue uniforms (`r descriptives$blue$print`), `r marginal_list$blue_x_red$print`, or yellow uniforms (`r descriptives$yellow$print`), `r marginal_list$red_x_yellow$print`. However, officers wearing blue and yellow uniforms had no difference in the severity of their injuries, `r marginal_list$blue_x_yellow$print`. Thus, my hypothesis was confirmed. These differences can be seen in Figure\ \@ref(fig:model-plot).

# Discussion

The results of our experiment confirmed that wearing a red uniform causes Starfleet officers to suffer more severe injuries, regardless of the division they work in. However, our results do not confirm the source of causality. That is, are the uniforms causing Starfleet officers to behave more recklessly, resulting in more severe injuries; or are the uniforms inviting external dangers across the cosmos? As of now we are unsure, but preliminary data suggests the former may be the culprit (see Figure\ \@ref(fig:redshirt-behaviour)).

## Limitations

Spock would like to remind our readers that, because their was no random assignment to division, this is not a true experiment. So our results should be taken with caution. Future studies building on the work here should consider randomly assigning participants both a uniform colour *and* division. Training exercises at Starfleet Academy would be an excellent candidate for such an experiment.

# Conclusion

It appears, after careful observation, that wearing a red Starfleet uniform during space exploration is bad for one's health, often leading to an untimely demise. As a doctor who does not wish to become an undertaker, it is my recommendation that Starfleet investigate the cause(s) underlying red uniform's effects on officer behaviour. To boldly go where no one has gone before.

## Open Science {.appendix}

The code and materials for analyzing data and generating the manuscript for this project are available in the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mccarthy-m-g/mccoy-and-spock-2287). This project was written using `r R.version.string` [@rcore2020] in RStudio version `r rstudioapi::versionInfo()$version` [@rstudio2021]. Statistical analyses were done using the `moments` [@moments2015], `car` [@car2019], `stats` [@rcore2020], and `emmeans` [@emmeans2021] R packages, and were assisted with the following packages and dependencies:

```{r packages-used, eval=FALSE}
# read renv.lock
renvLock <- jsonlite::read_json(here("renv.lock"))

# write R packages from renv.lock to r-packages.bib
knitr::write_bib(names(renvLock$Packages), "r-packages.bib")

# get location of package versions and sources
pkg_version <- paste0("renvLock$Packages$", names(renvLock$Packages), "$Version")
pkg_source <- paste0("renvLock$Packages$", names(renvLock$Packages), "$Repository")

# create tibble of packages, their versions, and their source
pkg_df <- tibble::tibble(
  package = names(renvLock$Packages),
  version = sapply(pkg_version, function(x) eval(parse(text = x))),
  source = sapply(pkg_source, function(x) eval(parse(text = x)))
)
# print table
pkg_df %>%
  kbl(caption = "All packages used in this paper.") %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(height = "250px")
```

To easily inspect the intermediate output of data analysis code pipes from this paper, we suggest using the `boomer` [@boomer2021] R package.

## Author Contributions {.appendix}

McCoy came up with the idea for this experiment and conducted all data collection and analysis. McCoy and Spock wrote this paper, however, Spock's main contribution was merely questioning McCoy's logic.
