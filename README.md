*Damn it, man, I'm a doctor, not an undertaker!*

This repository contains a fake scientific paper, written by Bones and Spock from the television series *Star Trek: The Original Series*, made for showcasing how to write a reproducible manuscript in R Markdown. I created it for a workshop as a follow-up to my talk [Doing reproducible science: An opinionated introduction](https://michaelmccarthy.netlify.app/talk/osssg-2021a/).

The project incorporates a number of principles crucial to reproducible science, including:

-   R package environment control using {renv}
-   Version control using GitHub
-   Continuous integration using GitHub Actions
-   Time stamps using GitHub Releases
-   Easy access for non-technical users using Open Science Framework integration
